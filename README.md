# smp_data
Data repository for my smp thesis project. This repo is meant as the binary blob companion containing data that is used in the smp_graphs `example_*` and `exprNNNN-*` experiments.

The idea of this repo is to provide a script that cooperates with smp_graphs and do the following:
 - check if SMP_GRAPHS_ROOT/experiments/data and set of defined subdirs exists
 - if no, download the data from storage at [1] and unpack it
